# Summary Conclusion

This data analysis provides valuable insights for stakeholders in the automotive industry, offering a glimpse into consumer preferences and market trends. Further exploration could focus on understanding the driving factors behind these preferences and their implications for marketing strategies and product development. One area of interest could be investigating the actual quantity of vehicles sold per brand to gain deeper insights into consumer preferences. Additionally, further analysis is needed to strengthen the understanding of cost distribution within the industry. The Average Price vs Mileage graph reveals a negative correlation coefficient of -0.34, indicating a potential relationship between price and mileage. However, more research is needed to establish a positive correlation. While the data shows that the average cost of cars in the USA falls between 10k-20k, each state's unique economic landscape influences vehicle costs, presenting distinct opportunities and challenges for growth and development.
